# Machine Learning Operations Project

In this project, we will analyze the lifecycle of a movie dataset from its transformation to training a machine learning model that can take a movie title as input and return a list recommending 5 movies similar to it.

Datasets that will be used: https://github.com/Arevalojj2020/PI_01/tree/main/datasets
