# Machine Learning Operations Project

In this project, we will analyze the lifecycle of a movie dataset from its data transformation to training a machine learning model that can take a movie title as input and return a list recommending 5 movies similar to it.

#### Datasets that will be used: https://github.com/Arevalojj2020/PI_01/tree/main/datasets

The workflow consists of: 
- Performing an ETL
- Developing an API
- Realize an exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Implementing a recommendation system
